    "text": "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the American Economic Review in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the AEA website and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of Harvard’s Dataverse.\nThis project seeks to replicate their results. I assess the balance of the experimental randomization, compare donation rates (and donation amounts), and finally use simulation to illustrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem. The following sections detail our approach, findings, and conclusions."

t-test and regression show no significant difference in months since last donation between treatment and control groups (p approximately 0.905). This suggests the randomization was successful, with balanced baseline characteristics. Table 1 in the original paper serves this same purpose, to demonstrate that treatment and control groups were comparable before the intervention."

T-test and Bivariate Linear Regression\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n# t-test\ncontrol_gave = df.loc[df[\"treatment\"] == 0, \"gave\"]\ntreatment_gave = df.loc[df[\"treatment\"] == 1, \"gave\"]\n\nt_stat_gave, p_val_gave = stats.ttest_ind(treatment_gave, control_gave, nan_policy=\"omit\")\nprint(\"T-test: Did treatment increase giving?\")\nprint(f\"t-statistic = {t_stat_gave:.4f}, p-value = {p_val_gave:.4f}\")\n\n# linear regression: gave ~ treatment\nreg_gave = smf.ols(\"gave ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"\\nBivariate Regression Output (gave ~ treatment):\")\nprint(reg_gave.summary().tables[1])\n\nT-test: Did treatment increase giving?\nt-statistic = 3.1014, p-value = 0.0019\n\nBivariate Regression Output (gave ~ treatment):\n==============================================================================\n                 coef    std err          t      P&gt;|t|      [0.025      0.975]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept      0.0179      0.001     16.225      0.000       0.016       0.020\ntreatment      0.0042      0.001      3.101      0.002       0.002       0.007\n==============================================================================\n\n\nInterpretation: The t-test and bivariate regression both show that individuals who received a matching donation offer were more likely to donate. The estimated increase in donation likelihood is approximately 0.4 percentage points and statistically significant. This result directly matches the response rates reported in Table 2A Panel A of the original study: 1.8 percent for the control group and 2.2 percent for the treatment group. These findings suggest that even small framing differences in fundraising appeals, like offering to match donations, can meaningfully affect people’s willingness to give.\n\n\n\n3. Probit Regression\n\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# probit regression\nprobit_model = smf.probit(\"gave ~ treatment\", data=df).fit(disp=False)\nprint(\"Probit Regression Output (gave ~ treatment):\")\nprint(probit_model.summary().tables[1])\n\nProbit Regression Output (gave ~ treatment):\n==============================================================================\n                 coef    std err          z      P&gt;|z|      [0.025      0.975]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept     -2.1001      0.023    -90.073      0.000      -2.146      -2.054\ntreatment      0.0868      0.028      3.113      0.002       0.032       0.141\n==============================================================================\n\n\nInterpretation: The coefficient on the treatment variable in the probit model is positive and statistically significant (p-value = 0.002). While the raw coefficient (0.0868) differs from the marginal effect reported in Table 3 of the paper (0.004), this is expected because probit models in statsmodels report coefficients on the latent index rather than marginal effects. Thus, our results successfully replicate Table 3, Column 1 in terms of direction, significance, and inference.\n\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n1. Create ratio1 Dummy and Summary of Donation Rates\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\n# Create dummy for 1:1 ratio group\ndf[\"ratio1\"] = 0\ndf.loc[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"ratio2\"] == 0) & (df[\"ratio3\"] == 0), \"ratio1\"] = 1\n\n# Show proportions\nprint(\"Proportion donating in each match ratio group:\")\nprint(\"1:1 match:\", df.loc[df[\"ratio1\"] == 1, \"gave\"].mean())\nprint(\"2:1 match:\", df.loc[df[\"ratio2\"] == 1, \"gave\"].mean())\nprint(\"3:1 match:\", df.loc[df[\"ratio3\"] == 1, \"gave\"].mean())\n\nProportion donating in each match ratio group:\n1:1 match: 0.020749124225276205\n2:1 match: 0.0226333752469912\n3:1 match: 0.022733399227244138\n\n\n\n\n\n2. T-Tests: Compare Donation Rates Between Match Ratios\n\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\ndf[\"ratio1\"] = 0\ndf.loc[(df[\"treatment\"] == 1) & (df[\"ratio2\"] == 0) & (df[\"ratio3\"] == 0), \"ratio1\"] = 1\n\n# Extract gave data\ngave_ratio1 = df.loc[df[\"ratio1\"] == 1, \"gave\"]\ngave_ratio2 = df.loc[df[\"ratio2\"] == 1, \"gave\"]\ngave_ratio3 = df.loc[df[\"ratio3\"] == 1, \"gave\"]\n\n# 1:1 vs 2:1\nt_stat_12, p_val_12 = stats.ttest_ind(gave_ratio1, gave_ratio2, nan_policy=\"omit\")\nprint(\"t-test (1:1 vs 2:1):\")\nprint(f\"t-statistic = {t_stat_12:.4f}, p-value = {p_val_12:.4f}\")\n\n# 2:1 vs 3:1\nt_stat_23, p_val_23 = stats.ttest_ind(gave_ratio2, gave_ratio3, nan_policy=\"omit\")\nprint(\"\\nt-test (2:1 vs 3:1):\")\nprint(f\"t-statistic = {t_stat_23:.4f}, p-value = {p_val_23:.4f}\")\n\nt-test (1:1 vs 2:1):\nt-statistic = -0.9650, p-value = 0.3345\n\nt-test (2:1 vs 3:1):\nt-statistic = -0.0501, p-value = 0.9600\n\n\nInterpretation: The t-tests comparing donation rates between match ratios show no statistically significant differences. The comparison between the 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 match groups has a p-value of 0.3345, and between the 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 groups, the p-value is 0.9600. These high p-values suggest that increasing the match ratio does not significantly increase the likelihood of donating. This supports the authors’ note that figures suggest the size of the match ratio has little impact on donor behavior.\n\n\n\n3. Regression: Donation ~ Match Ratio Group (OLS)\n\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\nreg_match = smf.ols(\"gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"Regression Output (gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3):\")\nprint(reg_match.summary().tables[1])\n\nRegression Output (gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3):\n==============================================================================\n                 coef    std err          t      P&gt;|t|      [0.025      0.975]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept      0.0179      0.001     16.225      0.000       0.016       0.020\nratio1         0.0029      0.002      1.661      0.097      -0.001       0.006\nratio2         0.0048      0.002      2.744      0.006       0.001       0.008\nratio3         0.0049      0.002      2.802      0.005       0.001       0.008\n==============================================================================\n\n\nInterpretation: The regression results show that the 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 match groups are associated with small but statistically significant increases in donation probability compared to the control group, with p-values below 0.01. The 1 : 1 group is not statistically significant. However, all coefficients are very small in magnitude, with increases less than 0.005. This suggests that although some match sizes show statistically significant differences, the practical effect is minimal. The treatment likely matters more than the exact size of the match.\n\n\n\n4. Direct Comparison of Response Rates\n\nprop_ratio1 = gave_ratio1.mean()\nprop_ratio2 = gave_ratio2.mean()\nprop_ratio3 = gave_ratio3.mean()\n\nprint(\"Direct Response Rate Differences:\")\nprint(f\"1:1 match: {prop_ratio1:.4%}\")\nprint(f\"2:1 match: {prop_ratio2:.4%}\")\nprint(f\"3:1 match: {prop_ratio3:.4%}\")\nprint(f\"\\n(2:1 - 1:1): {(prop_ratio2 - prop_ratio1):.4%}\")\nprint(f\"(3:1 - 2:1): {(prop_ratio3 - prop_ratio2):.4%}\")\n\nDirect Response Rate Differences:\n1:1 match: 2.0749%\n2:1 match: 2.2633%\n3:1 match: 2.2733%\n\n(2:1 - 1:1): 0.1884%\n(3:1 - 2:1): 0.0100%\n\n\nInterpretation: The direct response rate increases from 1 : 1 to 2 : 1 and from 2 : 1 to 3 : 1 are only 0.1884 percent and 0.0100 percent, respectively. These minimal changes confirm that the effect of increasing the match ratio is very small. The regression results mirror this finding, with similar small differences in the fitted coefficients. In conclusion, the size of the matched donation offer does not meaningfully affect donor response rates, reinforcing the idea that the presence of a match matters more than how generous it is.\n\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\n1. Regression on Full Sample\n\nreg_amount = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\nprint(\"Regression of Donation Amount on Treatment (Full Sample):\")\nprint(reg_amount.summary().tables[1])\n\nRegression of Donation Amount on Treatment (Full Sample):\n==============================================================================\n                 coef    std err          t      P&gt;|t|      [0.025      0.975]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept      0.8133      0.067     12.063      0.000       0.681       0.945\ntreatment      0.1536      0.083      1.861      0.063      -0.008       0.315\n==============================================================================\n\n\nInterpretation: In the full sample, the regression shows that the treatment group donated slightly more on average than the control group. The coefficient on the treatment variable is 0.1536, suggesting a small positive effect, but it is not statistically significant at the 5 percent level (p = 0.063). This means we cannot confidently conclude that offering a matching donation increased average donation amounts. The result suggests a weak effect that may be driven by the increased number of donors in the treatment group, rather than larger donation sizes.\n\n\n\n2. Regression Among Donors Only\n\ndf_donors = df[df[\"amount\"] &gt; 0]\nreg_amount_donors = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=df_donors).fit()\nprint(\"Regression of Donation Amount on Treatment (Donors Only):\")\nprint(reg_amount_donors.summary().tables[1])\n\nRegression of Donation Amount on Treatment (Donors Only):\n==============================================================================\n                 coef    std err          t      P&gt;|t|      [0.025      0.975]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept     45.5403      2.423     18.792      0.000      40.785      50.296\ntreatment     -1.6684      2.872     -0.581      0.561      -7.305       3.968\n==============================================================================\n\n\nInterpretation: Among those who donated, the regression shows that the treatment group gave slightly less on average than the control group, but the difference is not statistically significant. This suggests that while the treatment may affect the decision to donate, it does not meaningfully change how much people give once they decide to donate. The result is descriptive and should not be interpreted as causal.\n\n\n\n3. Histograms of Donation Amounts (Donors Only)\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndonations_treatment = df_donors.loc[df_donors[\"treatment\"] == 1, \"amount\"]\ndonations_control = df_donors.loc[df_donors[\"treatment\"] == 0, \"amount\"]\n\nmean_treatment = donations_treatment.mean()\nmean_control = donations_control.mean()\n\n# Histogram for Treatment group\nplt.figure()\nplt.hist(donations_treatment, bins=30)\nplt.axvline(mean_treatment, color='red', linewidth=2, label=f\"Mean = {mean_treatment:.2f}\")\nplt.title(\"Histogram of Donation Amounts (Treatment, Donors Only)\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Donation Amount\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n# Histogram for Control group\nplt.figure()\nplt.hist(donations_control, bins=30)\nplt.axvline(mean_control, color='red', linewidth=2, label=f\"Mean = {mean_control:.2f}\")\nplt.title(\"Histogram of Donation Amounts (Control, Donors Only)\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Donation Amount\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: The two histograms show the distribution of donation amounts among people who donated, with a red vertical line indicating the group mean.\nThe distributions are similarly right-skewed, and the treatment group shows a slightly lower mean. This visual pattern supports the regression result: among donors, the treatment did not increase donation size and may have slightly reduced it, though not significantly.\nThese plots provide helpful context: while the treatment increased the probability of donating (from earlier analysis), it did not increase how much people gave when they did choose to donate."

As the number of observations increases, the cumulative average stabilizes and gets closer to the true difference of 0.004, shown by the red dashed line. This illustrates the Law of Large Numbers, which tells us that with enough observations, the average of the observed data approaches the expected value.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\n\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\nn_iterations = 1000\n\nfor n in sample_sizes:\n    diffs = []\n    for _ in range(n_iterations):\n        treat_sample = np.random.binomial(1, 0.022, n)\n        control_sample = np.random.binomial(1, 0.018, n)\n        diff = treat_sample.mean() - control_sample.mean()\n        diffs.append(diff)\n    \n    # Plot histogram\n    plt.figure()\n    plt.hist(diffs, bins=30)\n    plt.title(f\"Histogram of Difference in Means (n = {n})\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"Difference in Mean Donation Probability\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n    plt.axvline(np.mean(diffs), color='red', linewidth=2,\n                label=f\"Mean = {np.mean(diffs):.4f}\")\n    plt.legend()\n    plt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: The four histograms above show the distribution of 1,000 simulated differences in mean donation probability between treatment and control groups, for sample sizes of 50, 200, 500, and 1000. At smaller sample sizes like 50, the distribution is wide and less symmetric, with more extreme values and visible skew. As the sample size increases, the distribution becomes tighter and more bell-shaped, concentrating around the true mean difference. This reflects the Central Limit Theorem, which states that as sample size grows, the sampling distribution of the mean difference approaches a normal distribution. In each plot, the red vertical line represents the sample mean. At larger sample sizes like 500 and 1000, zero is clearly not at the center of the distribution, which shows that the observed difference in donation rates is unlikely to be due to chance alone when sample sizes are large."
