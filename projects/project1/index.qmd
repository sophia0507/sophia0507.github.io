Let's investigate the relationship between fuel efficiency (`mpg`) and engine displacement (`disp`) from the `mtcars` dataset. Those variables have a correlation of `r cor(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp) |> format(digits=2)`.

# Header

Let's investigate the relationship between fuel efficiency (`mpg`) and engine displacement (`disp`) from the `mtcars` dataset. These variables have a negative correlation.

## Sub-Header

Here is a plot:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
from pydataset import data
mtcars = data('mtcars')

# Plot
sns.set_theme(style="whitegrid")
sns.scatterplot(data=mtcars, x="mpg", y="disp", color="dodgerblue")
plt.title("MPG vs Displacement")
plt.show()
